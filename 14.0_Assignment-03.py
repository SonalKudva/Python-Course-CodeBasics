'''Imagine you run a loyalty program where customers earn rewards based on the total amount they have spent. The rewardslevels are defined based on the total purchase amount. Based on this scenario, complete the following tasks.''''''Question-01:You are given a file called customers.txt that contains the name of the customer and total amount they spent. Read this file line by line and save the customer name and total amount in a dictionary.For example, customers.txt file will content the data in the following format,Srinivas,120John,250Maria,150Smith,510Anjali,45You will read this and build a dictionary like this,{    "Srinivas": 120,    "John": 250,    "Maria": 150,    "Smith": 510,    "Anjali": 45}'''import csv# Initialize an empty dictionary to store customer datacustomers_dict = {}# Open the csv file and read its contents; function to read the customer data from file and populate customer_dictdef load_customer_data():    global customers_dict    with open("C:\\Users\\DELL\\PycharmProjects\\CodeBasics\\Data\\customers.txt", "r") as file:        csv_reader = csv.reader(file)        next(csv_reader)  # This skips the header        for row in csv_reader:            # The first item in the row is the name, and the second is amount            name = row[0].strip()            amount = int(row[1].strip())            # Add name and amount to the dictionary            customers_dict[name] = amountload_customer_data()# Print each key-value pair on a new lineprint("The contents of the dictionary are:")for name, amount in customers_dict.items():    print(f"{name}: {amount}")'''Question 2:Task 2The rewards levels are defined below based on the total purchase amount.
